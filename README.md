#SMUSS

Smuss was a short project I did to learn more about C# / Monogame development. It was one of my first projects in Game development.

It is a top-down action-RPG where you can simply move around and roll. I made it so I could learn about Graphic Tiling, dialogue handling, Camera, and character controls. 

In this project I learned a lot about xml parsing and encoding, having created a pipeline to import JSON-encoded tilemaps off spritesheets with several layers of detail. I used a tool called Tiled! to draw the maps that I imported into the game
